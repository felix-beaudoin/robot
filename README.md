# Robot Construction Project

## Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a 3D robot scene from scratch:

    Creating transformation matrices for scaling, rotation and translation
    Putting up a hierarchy between the body members (the arms follow the torso -> the forearm follows the arms -> etc.)
    Animating a walking animation
